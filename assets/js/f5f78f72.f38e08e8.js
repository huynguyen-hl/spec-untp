Trust anchors are national or international authorities that typically run existing business or product registration, certification, accreditation, or other high integrity processes. Examples of trust anchors include national regulators that govern things like land ownership or business registrations. Another example are the national accreditation bodies that audit and accredit certifiers to issue third party assessments.
